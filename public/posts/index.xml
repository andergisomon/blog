      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this after my last paper for my second semester of my second year. Recently, just a week ago on Friday we submitted our course project for EFB2073 - Microprocessor and Computer Architecture. It was a fun course although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how well I did on the tests. Semester results would be out a month from now. Anyways it was one of those courses that really did push me to learn and discover more.</description>

      <description>This post details some of my current projects. I wrote this after lunch after finishing my first exam paper.
Major projects Pimato font project - Taarau Pimato is a constructed writing system I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on since the last 7 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to make a font 3 years ago but only got around doing it 2 months ago.
Taarau is the name of the first font for Pimato, it comes from the word arau which means to rush.</description>
