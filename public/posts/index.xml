&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I updated my site. A lot has happened since then. I&amp;rsquo;m now in the first semester of my third year at UTP. This will be my last semester on campus before embarking on an internship, away from campus, and away from home. It&amp;rsquo;s honestly been such a journey so far, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;m gonna share a part of that journey. One of the best memories I had made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this after my last paper for my second semester of my second year. Recently, just a week ago on Friday we submitted our course project for EFB2073 - Microprocessor and Computer Architecture. It was a fun course although I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how well I did on the tests. Semester results would be out a month from now. Anyways it was one of those courses that really did push me to learn and discover more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post details some of my current projects. I wrote this after lunch after finishing my first exam paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;major-projects&#34;&gt;Major projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pimato-font-project---taarau&#34;&gt;Pimato font project - Taarau&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimato is a constructed writing system I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on since the last 7 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to make a font 3 years ago but only got around doing it 2 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taarau is the name of the first font for Pimato, it comes from the word &lt;em&gt;arau&lt;/em&gt; which means to rush. I&amp;rsquo;ve been intending to rush the development of the font as I believed as long as it looks close enough to my vision, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. But as the weeks ago by I can&amp;rsquo;t help but scrutinize its tiny details. Professional fonts typically take 2 years to develop, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this font won&amp;rsquo;t be a professional one because I need to start making materials with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
