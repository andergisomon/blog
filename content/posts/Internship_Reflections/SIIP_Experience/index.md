### Cultural fluency
That time I confused the CEO in front of every employee during a townhall.

How does one talk to Germans and Americans in the flesh?

I've dealt with Berliners virtually. They're as Americanized as I am so interactions were smooth sailing.

### Cross-silo communication
Try explaining raster vs. vector graphics in a fast-moving high-stakes environment.

### Issue triage
Sometimes you need to hold back information preemptively.

### HAZOP
Somebody lost a bit of their finger

### Kinda-funny moments
That one time a sister company employee accidentally forwarded me emails about troubles with a customer from the Levant. I was told to 'please' ignore them in German, an international lingua franca.

That one time I was looking for signs of life for the Ethernet POWERLINK stack and was greeted with a post that began with "Hallo together" [sic].

And another time when I had to fill out personal info just to get a bunch of PDFs. Turns out that form goes directly to the CEO's inbox, because I was forwarded an email chain from the Singaporean distributor.

Stranger fills in personal data > Goes to the CEO's inbox somewhere in the Levant > Goes to Singaporean office > Goes to that guy's subordinate

And what did I get? A SharePoint link to a Windows installer. I had to install the software and dig through the Program Files directory to get the PDFs I wanted.
