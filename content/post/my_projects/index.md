This post details some of my current projects. I wrote this after lunch after finishing my first exam paper.

## Major projects

### Pimato font project - Taarau
Pimato is a constructed writing system I've been working on since the last 7 years. I've been planning to make a font 3 years ago but only got around doing it 2 months ago.

Taarau is the name of the first font for Pimato, it comes from the word *arau* which means to rush. I've been intending to rush the development of the font as I believed as long as it looks close enough to my vision, it doesn't matter. But as the weeks ago by I can't help but scrutinize its tiny details. Professional fonts typically take 2 years to develop, I'm hoping that this font won't be a professional one because I need to start making materials with it.

### Kayan TTS/ASR transfer learning from related Apo-Duat language model
I've been wanting to finetune a related pretrained Apo-Duat language model from Meta's MMS suite of [ASR/TTS models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/mms "Title") for a year now but have never found the time to do it. This semester break I intend on actually working on it. More specifically, I want to see if it's possible to reduce the compute requirements by repurposing the Penan (pez) or Lundayeh (lnd) weights.
